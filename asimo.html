        <p>On November 20th, 2000, Honda announced ASIMO which stands for "Advanced Step in Innovative MObility".<sup><a style="color:#1e63c9"; href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> ASIMO was developed at Honda's Research & Development Wako Fundamental Technical Research Center in Japan. With the design of a child wearing a space suit, it was developed with a purpose in mind, to be a helper to humans in every day life. This vision drove purposeful constraints, being just the right size to operate in a home or office environment and range of motion to reach doorknobs and light switches. ROBODEX 2000, three days after ASIMO's unveiling, was it's first general public appearance. On December 21st, it would be announced that Honda would start renting out ASIMO units in fall of 2001 for $150,000 a month.<sup><a style="color:#1e63c9"; href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

        <p>ASIMO stands 120 cm tall and weighs 43 kg. Coming from P3, reducing height from 160 cm to 120 cm, they were able to find more weight reductions through thinning the internal skeletal structure and frame thickness, and also by reducing the control unit size, rather than it being just a scaled down version of the P3.</p>

            <h3>Mobility</h3>

            <p>i-WALK (Intelligent Real-Time Flexible Walking). The technology behind ASIMO's (at the time never before seen) capabilities, enables smooth and continuous walking and changes in direction. When humans approach a sharp corner while walking, we don't walk up next to it, stop, turn , then continue walking. We shift our center of gravity in towards the corner, walking in a continuous, curved motion. Using 6-axis force sensors in the feet and gyro/acceleration sensors in the torso, its possible to predict where it's center of gravity will be while walking, adjusting its current center of gravity to compensate in real-time. Enabling walking speeds of up to 1.6 km/h.</p>
            <p>It's movement capabilities include walking, crab walking, diagonal walking, turning in place, and cornering. However, these movements were limited to 2D terrain, with the exception of specially designed stairs that were built with millimeter accuracy in mind. 3D terrain adaptability had not been implemented.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Hardware</h3>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="asimo/ASIMOuncovered.jpg" class="center-image">
        </div>
        <p>On November 16th, 2001 at Robo Festa Kanagawa 2001, we got a good look inside of what makes up ASIMO's internal structure.<sup><a style="color:#1e63c9"; href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Even though the ASIMO 2001 had been announced by this point, the one being displayed is the ASIMO 2000 as it still has the cable conduits running to the back of the legs, which are not present on ASIMO 2001.</p>
        <p>Starting off, the skeletal structure is made from a light weight, high strength magnesium alloy, with the exterior shell (not present) made up of plastic resin. It has 26 degrees of freedom (DoF). Compared to P3, the shoulder joint was now attached at a 20 degree angle, making it possible to raise it's arms higher than it's shoulders.</p>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="asimo/torso.jpg" class="center-image">
        </div>
        <p>At the torso, we can see the 38.4V 10 Ah Ni-MH battery in white plastic, and its location giving it a good center of gravity. Average run time was approximately 30 minutes, with charging taking 4 hours. However, with it's battery being located in it's lower torso, it could quickly be replaced with a fully charged one. The battery made up 18% of the total weight, weighing in at 7.7 kg and is the single heaviest component. A 100V AC/15A outlet is necessary to charge the cells or to run tethered.</p>
        <p>Each hand having 1 DoF, the fingers are wire-driven with a gripping force was 0.5 kg. When trying to grip an object, the index finger starts to close. Once it has made contact with the object, the next finger closes, and so on.</p>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="asimo/backpack1.jpg" class="center-image">
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="asimo/backpack2.jpg" class="center-image">
        </div>
        <p>Now, located in the backpack is where everything really happens. At the top is where the main computer lives. There are is an undisclosed number of CPUs onboard. Wireless antennas can be seen on both sides of its enclosure. Below are power supplies with four Sanyo Denki San Ace MC cooling fans placed on each side of the enclosure.</p>
        <p>Another thing you can see from this angle, directly below where the battery is located is how the hip's yaw axis is driven. The motor is not attached to the torso, but instead what looks like a canister attached at the hip structure, meaning that each leg is self contained (functionality wise), and probably makes it easier for maintenance.</p>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="asimo/thigh.jpg" class="center-image">
        </div>
        <p>As you can see, power is transmitted to the knee through a belt, with the motor located in its upper thigh. You can also see the same mechanism for the ankle's pitch axis and for the hip's roll axis. The hip's pitch axis is most likely directly driven, with its location being in the center of that hip joint.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="asimo/14042.jpg">
            <img src="asimo/14043.jpg">    
        </div>
        <p>Each actuator consisted of a servo motor, harmonic reducer, and a drive unit. 12 of the motors and drivers are from Mitsuba, making up over 40% of the actuators used throughout ASIMO's body.<sup><a style="color:#1e63c9"; href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Mitsuba developed custom DC brushless motors for use in the lower half of ASIMO, with key requirements being ease of control and responsiveness.</p>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="asimo/head.jpg" class="center-image">
        </div>
        <p>And lastly, we take a look at its head. We can see its components relating to its mechanisms for the head motion. Based on what information is available, I'm lead to believe that ASIMO is not equipped with stereo CCD cameras at this stage. With this generation, there were no functions that could take advantage of those sensors. Its eyes would be purely for aesthetic purposes.</p>

        <p>On November 12th, 2001, an announcement of a new ASIMO model was made.<sup><a style="color:#1e63c9"; href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> However it was clear that this was more of a refinement of ASIMO 2000.</p>
        
        <h3>Hardware</h3>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="asimo/2001_02.jpg">
            <img src="asimo/2001_03.jpg">    
        </div>
        <p>There were three changes to the hardware. First was the addition of a CCD camera positioned between the legs. This gave ASIMO a better sense of it's surroundings, now being able to track markers placed on the ground, making positioning easier and more accurate.<sup><a style="color:#1e63c9"; href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Next, the cable conduit that ran from the backpack to the back of the legs has been removed. And lastly, the design of the backpack changed, becoming sleaker and adding defined ventalation ducts.</p>
        <h3>Software</h3>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="asimo/asimo2000_04.jpg" class="center-image">
        </div>
        <p>One of the biggest improvements would be to i-WALK, adding the capability of walking in three dimensions, making it possible to climb stairs and slopes. ASIMO 2000 also had the ability to climb stairs, however it was not adaptive. For it to work, every stair had to be within millimeter accuracy.<sup><a style="color:#1e63c9"; href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></p>
        <p>Startup time was reduced from 40 minutes to 4 minutes. The time reduction comes from automating the manual tasks previously needed during startup, such as calibrating sensors and actuator limits. Also, the offline tasks can now be run on a single laptop, as software and hardware had progressed so there was no longer need for a workstation PC.</p>
        
        <h3>Appearances</h3>
        February 14, 2002 - ASIMO rings NYSE bell


        <h2>2002 (Software Revision)</h2>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="asimo/pointing.jpg" class="center-image">
        </div>
        <p>On December 5th, 2002, ASIMO was <a style="color:#1e63c9"; href="https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2002/1205/honda.htm">upgraded</a> to track and recognize faces, and follow human gestures, like moving to where someone is pointing to or halting in place. It could also recognize the <a style="color:#1e63c9"; href="https://global.honda/jp/ASIMO/history/asimo/technology2002/index.html">posture</a> of a person and recognize its environment. Also, with added internet connectivity, it was able to provide news and weather updates.</p>
        <p>As of February 21st, 2002 in an article by <a style="color:#1e63c9;" href="https://www.forbes.com/2002/02/21/0221tentech.html?sh=2b10ba9bf3eb">Forbes</a>, it was revealed that 20 ASIMO units had been built up to that point, all hand assembled in their research facility in Wako, Japan. It was also revealed that a single unit costs just under $1 million to make.</p>
        <p>The overall system architecture as been redeveloped. For preplanned routes, ASIMO interfaces with a external map management system located offline. It can also trigger dialogue and other tasks at given locations. However onboard, 3 separate processors handle image processing, speech recognition and synthesis, and control and planning respectively. A frame grabber is connected to the vision computer via a PCI bus.</p>
        <h3>Software</h3>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="asimo/wired7.jpg" class="center-image">
        </div>
        <p>The image pipeline consisted of stereo SONY XC-ES alternate 1/3" color CCDs, with a depth map generated using a SAD (Sum of Absolute values of Differences) based method on a Mobile Pentium III-M 1.2GHz. 3D objects and moving objects are then extracted by taking images from the frame grabber and processing them on the vision computer, sending necessary data to the navigation and interaction systems. In order to calculate distance and direction of objects in a scene, the image had to be synchronized with every joint angle, calculating the camera pose. With this, detecting multiple moving objects in an image was now possible. ASIMO stores the extracted objects' bounding boxes in its local map, necessary for obstacle avoidance for planning detours.</p>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="asimo/wired4.jpg" class="center-image">
        </div>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="asimo/wired5.jpg" class="center-image">
        </div>
        <p>To track humans, they need to be extracted from the image. An optical flow based algorithm separates the foreground from the image, then Snake algorithm extracts the human shapes, separating multiple people in a scene. Face detection then uses skin color to identify face contours.</p>
        <p>There are two gesture recognition systems. The first is 2D, recognizing gestures including handshake, hand circling, bye-bye, hand swing, high-hand and come here call. And the second is 3D, recognizing pointing gestures, using the head and hand positional relationship and the depth map to then move to the desired location.</p>
        <p>ASIMO is capable of storing and identifying about 10 people. The database of faces and the details along with them are stored on the external management system.</p>
        <p>The planning system is behavior based, allowing flexibility and modularity, making reactive in rapidly changing environments.</p>
        <p>For a more in depth analysis on how each of the onboard systems work together, check out this <a style="color:#1e63c9;" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3972237_The_intelligent_ASIMO_System_overview_and_integration">paper</a>.</p>

        <h2>2003 (Hardware Revision)</h2>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="asimo/2003_01.jpg" class="center-image">
        </div>
        <p>April 3rd at Robodex 2003, a silver ASIMO walked out onto the Mega Stage for the first and only time.<sup><a style="color:#1e63c9"; href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Garnering the name ASIMO R from the "R" logo on its head and backpack, it was obvious that this new version was more than just aesthetic update.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="asimo/2003_02.jpg">
            <img src="asimo/2003_03.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>Compairing ASIMO R to ASIMO 2002, the differences become more obvious. Taking a look at the legs, they are notably a lot thicker. Now being able to walk 3km/h, nearly double the speed of the previous model, it was necessary to upgrade the hardware. Watching it walk looks like the footage had been sped-up or the feet are sticking to the ground, but that is infact its real speed.</p>

        <p>The arms have gone throught some changes as well. First, the elbow is now double jointed, as previously the elbow hinge was slightly offset forward to allow the arm to close in tighter, the new design allows for more natural arm movements. And secondly, the forearms are much thicker.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the backpack now has a thinner, sleaker design with less ventalation.</p>

        <h2>2004 (Version 2)</h2>
        <div>
            <img src="asimo/2004_01.jpg" class="center-image">
        </div>
        <p>On December 15th, 2004, Honda announced ASIMO's second major version update. This generation brings a total overhaul of every system. New control theory, upgraded hardware, and useful interactive functions.</p>
        <h3>Hardware</h3>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="asimo/2004_04.jpg" class="center-image">
        </div>
        <p>Now using an infrared camera, it's able to correct it's position while walking, regardless of the lighting conditions. Adding to the sensor suite are ultrasonic sensors located around the waist, more specifically, aiming behind and to the side. This gives it better awareness and obstacle avoidance.</p>

        <h3>Software</h3>
        <h3>Variations</h3>
        <div class="center-image">
            <img src="asimo/2004_06.jpg" class="center-image">
        </div>
        <p>On December 15th, 2004, during ASIMO's first press demonstration, two different variations made their debut. The first, we already discussed and is the official version, but the second actually came out on stage first, with a different set of legs.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="asimo/2004_09.jpg">
            <img src="asimo/2004_08.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>The legs on this variation are, at least from the exterior, the exact same legs as ASIMO R (2003). To my knowledge, this was the only time it was seen. I am unaware of why they chose to do this, but we can speculate. Assuming that these legs were used throughout the development stage, having hardware capable of testing the new control software before the new legs were finished, it's possible there was a feature that they wanted to show off that wasn't fully reliable on the new legs, or they needed two ASIMOs on stage but only had this prototype available at the time, or something completely different. Whatever the reason, it's still interesting that two different variations of the same ASIMO model were onstage at the same time.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The first prototype is an experimental humanoid robot based off of ASIMO 2011.<sup><a style="color:#1e63c9"; href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> The kinematic configurations and major specifications are the same, but with the addition of one axis force sensors at the hip and both shoulders, as well as other changes that have no further detail.</p>
        <p>The same prototype is seen in a video attached to a research paper released at the IEEE International Conference on Humanoid Robots 2017. The paper describes a method of recovering from being pushed.<sup><a style="color:#1e63c9"; href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup></p>
        <p>Both the video released by Honda Research and the video by NHK seem to show the same prototype recovering from the same type of pushes, released more than 4 years apart. During ASIMO 2011's first apperance in North American on April 19th, 2014, along with providing their versioning schema for their ASIMO models, Honda claimed that ASIMO Version 4 was in early development.<sup><a style="color:#1e63c9"; href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> I believe that this "experimental humanoid robot based off of ASIMO 2011" could possibly be a very early prototype of ASIMO Version 4.</p>
        <p>Now, the second prototype is more of a research platform for experimental technologies, such as traversing uneven terrain using a laser rangefinder array. It uses the same leg design as the first protype, but it looks to be a bit taller. The general design is very reminiscent of Honda E series robots.</p>
